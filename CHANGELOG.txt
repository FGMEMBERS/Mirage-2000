- ENGINE :
------------
- Correction the Nasal
- Exhaust/thurst update (double nozzle)
- Improved "Mouse" -> Inlet cones for supersonic flight  ... ( they go out > Mach 1.25 ).
- Reheat Correction (Using n value, instead of throttle value)

- Electric flight control : 
---------------------------
- Slats : they have an automated movement, during flight, and are retracted when landing (but still can be reopened manualy in case of engine failure)
- SAS System Stabilizer Automatic Flight Stabilizer flight depending on the position of the joystick ( Still job to do to improve that )
Note : this make stick less sensitive for low stick value or high speed. Also work for the nosewheel : > 10kts it become more stable with speed increasing

- Nasal :
---------
- Centralization of "init" functions of the various systems , (to "revive" systems in case of faillure (real or simulated crash) and help "restart" management (in the future)) -> This still need to be improved
- More reviews in the party " missile.nas " ( <- Not Enough)
- Correction of some bugs in nav & radar

- Graphical stuff :
-------------------
- High resolution texture (2048 * 2048) I made only 2 , but it's really pretty.
- Adding pilot view

- Instrument/Alert :
--------------------
- Jettinson : Yellow and black button to drop the tanks in case of emergency ( I rebossÃ© texture button) and ajjout a keyboard shortcut (Shift + J). This helps unlock the full keypad, and so those who use it for steering can be used without problems.
- HUD : Change the target display in the HUD : This overlaped and did not read all the infos. Everything is readable now.
- Stall Warning Alert + stall (On the HUD and on the alert panel)
- Transponder : Working transponder. Actually only the civilian part of the Transpondeur is working

- Loads :
---------
- Quick loads are closer in name and in load to what we can see on a real mirage 2000

-Other Stuff :
--------------
- Normalisation in order to make this aircraft available to "Aircraft_Selection_Criteria" (but not finished yet)
